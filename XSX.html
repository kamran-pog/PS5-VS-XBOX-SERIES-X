        <h3> About XSX/S </h3>
        <p>The Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S (collectively, the Xbox Series X/S[b]) are home video game consoles
            developed by Microsoft. They were both released on November 10, 2020, as the fourth generation of the Xbox
            console family, succeeding the Xbox One family. Along with Sony's PlayStation 5, also released in November
            2020, the Xbox Series X and Series S are part of the ninth generation of video game consoles.

            Rumors regarding the consoles first emerged in early 2019, with the line as a whole codenamed "Scarlett" and
            consisting of high-end and lower-end models codenamed "Anaconda" and "Lockhart" respectively. Internally,
            Microsoft had been satisfied with the two-console approach for the Xbox One and planned a similar approach
            for the fourth generation Xbox, with the target for the high-end model to at least double the performance of
            the Xbox One X. The high-end model was first teased during E3 2019 under the title "Project Scarlett," while
            its name and design as Xbox Series X was unveiled during The Game Awards later in December. In September
            2020, Microsoft unveiled the lower-end model as the Xbox Series S.
